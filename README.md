# Leandro Proen√ßa

15+ years programming, I've been working on a variety of business domains and programming languages. You can see a brief of my career through my [Linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/leandronsp).

Also, I have experience mentoring and teaching programming languages to newcomers, where my main goal is to help them to understand fundamental topics in computer engineering with ease. 

Frequently, I use to write technical content in my [personal blog](http://leandronsp.com), [dev.to/leandronsp](https://dev.to/leandronsp) as well as in my [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/leandronsp). 

## Open source contributions
Here I highlight some projects I did some contribution:

* [rails/activeresource](https://github.com/rails/activeresource) - REST objects for Rails applications
* [emqx/emqtt](https://github.com/emqx/emqtt) - an MQTT client library written in Erlang
* [senny/sablon](https://github.com/senny/sablon) - a document template processor for Word written in Ruby
