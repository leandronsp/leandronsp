# Leandro Proença

15+ years programming, I've been working on a variety of business domains and programming languages. You can see a brief of my career through my [Linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/leandronsp).

Also, I have experience mentoring and teaching programming languages to newcomers, where my main goal is to help them to understand fundamental topics in computer engineering with ease. 

Frequently, I use to write technical content in my [personal blog](http://leandronsp.com) as well as in my [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/leandronsp). 

## Open source contributions
Here I highlight some projects I did some contribution:

* [rails/activeresource](https://github.com/rails/activeresource) - REST objects for Rails applications
* [emqx/emqtt](https://github.com/emqx/emqtt) - an MQTT client library written in Erlang
* [senny/sablon](https://github.com/senny/sablon) - a document template processor for Word written in Ruby

## Personal projects
Following I can show some of my personal projects:

### adelnor
adelnor is a dead simple, yet Rack-compatible, HTTP server written in Ruby.

### yata
It's the *cliché* "ToDo list", a simple project written in pure Ruby with no frameworks with the intent to teach fundamental topics of web in general in my mentoring sessions.

### morphine
A neural network written in Elixir. It was very helpful because I could get rid of the Brazilian market during the Brazil's political crisis circa 2016.

### endinir
The missing pieces for understanding computer engineering topics with practical examples. Also used in my mentoring sessions.

### fun
A miscellaneous project where I experiment on a variety of programming languages and tools over my entire career, ranging from C, Java and Ruby to Haskell, Clojure and Elixir. It's also my meetpoint of practicing algorithms and data structures.
